# NewYork-Taxi-Fare-Price-Prediction
This is the Web app which helps to predict the taxi fare price in the New York city.
This web app is created using streamlit and deployed on Heroku platform.
The dataset of "New York taxi price" is taken from the kaggle.
Python language and its libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn,Seaborn, Matplotlib, and streamlit are used.
Following metrices are used: Mean absolute error, Mean squared error and R squared score.

Following parameter are being concerned for predicting the Fare price: 

      1. No.of Passengers
      2. Trip distance calculated by Taxi meter
      3. Rate code ID 
      4. New ride or previously happened ride in the dataset

This web app will help to predict the taxi fare price in the New York city.
Performed proper Data cleaning, Handling missing values, and Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset.
Multiple Algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Bagging, XG Boost,etc are used to check the best performance.
Enhanced R2 Score from 72% to 92% and reduced RMSE from 5% to 3%.
